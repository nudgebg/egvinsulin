#### Data gaps
Gaps in data are typically not reported. While we consider basal rates as active until the next rate, it should be clear that in cases of missing data, basal rate outdate at some point. At this moment we have not implemented any method to detect or deal with data gaps. Therefore, it is left to the user of this toolbox to detect data gaps and/or mark basal rates as outdated. As a general rule, in AID basal rates typically change very often unless micro bolusing is used. One value per day is the absolute minimum that we have seen (flat basal in some users).
