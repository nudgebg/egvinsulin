# How to Contribute

We are delighted that you're interested in contributing to BabelBetes! BabelBetes aims to standardize publicly available clinical diabetes trial datasets. We welcome contributions that extend its functionality and the number of supported datasets as well as its usability.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Adding New Datasets & Functionality

We are delighted to see the number of supported study datasets growing. Also, we want to see other experts improve and extend the supported datatypes and functionality. 

Before you start implementing, we advice your to 

 1. familiarize with the [project](./README.md)
 2. Checkout the documentation of [currently supported studies](./README.md#supported-studies)
 3. Work with the [Checklist](./checklist.md) when adding a new `StudyDataset` class


### 2. Reporting and Resolving Bugs

If you encounter problems, bugs, or see ways to improve the toolbox, we are there to help. We use github to maintain an overview of open todos, bugs and next steps. Therefore, we encourage you to:  

 - Open github ([issues](https://github.com/nudgebg/egvinsulin/issues) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/nudgebg/egvinsulin/discussions))
 - Create pull requests (PR) to suggest changes
 - Become an active github collaborator (reach out to us directly)

## Documentation
!!! info
    The strongest efforts have been made to ensure that the way we extract data from the datsets is correct and assumptions are properly documented. Therefore, all [currently supported studies](./README.md/#supported-studies) come with analysis (jupyter notebooks) and documentations. Therefore, it is important that: 
    
    - For new datasets, documentation (as markdown files) and analysis scripts (as jupyter notebooks) are added
    - For changes, existing documentation and scripts are updated


## Using the Toolbox
We are excited if as many people benefit from BabelBetes!
No matter if you are an individual, a research organization or a company, please make sure to give credit to the authors and contributors of the project. And provide feedback to improve the project.

- Don't hesitate to reach out for guidance on how to use the toolbox effectively.
- Follow our [best practices](best-practices.md) to handle issues like missing data and dataset inconsistencies.

## As an Investigator
Our findings highlight the complexities of working with different study datasets and the challenges researchers face. If you are interested in improving study data quality and making it more "shovel-ready," refer to our [recommendations] and don't hesitate to reach out to us directly.

## Getting in Touch

For problems with the toolbox, please **first** consult the github issues and discussions pages:   

 1. Create github ([issues](https://github.com/nudgebg/egvinsulin/issues) for bugs, suggestions
 2. Start github [discussion](https://github.com/nudgebg/egvinsulin/discussions)) for feedback, questions etc.

For further questions or discussions, feel free to reach out to us at [info@nudgebg.com](mailto:info@nudgebg.com).

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you!
