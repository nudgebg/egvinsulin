DCLP5 - https://public.jaeb.org/datasets/diabetes
IOBP2 - https://public.jaeb.org/datasets/diabetes

# To run files
update the file path for where the original data is stored and where the cleaned data will be stored in the run_functions.py file.
Run the run_functions.py file.
Before running DCLP3, open PtRoster_a.txt and save it in the same location as a CSV with the same name. There is an issue in the original .txt file that doesn't allow it to be opened in python.
